App to learn hanja

## to-do
- dictionary mode
  - ~~display hanja based on reading~~
  - ~~based on stroke count~~ (is there a better way to do this?)
  - ~~click hanja to go to info page~~
  - format a bit more nicely
- menu for each mode
- quiz
  - fill in blank, either hanja, reading, name, meaning
  - multiple choice versions
- just make pretty ~
- show incomplete entries somewhere, mb can use it as a list to improve upon
- feedback section? bug reports, etc.
- make look good on mobile
- use that korean derived file for something?
- is there a better database to use?

## to-fix
- some definitions + names missing space after comma
- some blank/incomplete hanja
- some names include first definition (due to first char being '(', it seems)
